# NYC Squirrel Census Visualization Project

<img src="./assets/squirrels.jpg" width="500" height="500">

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create an interactive web application using React to visualize and analyze the data from the New York City Squirrel Census. Your application will retrieve data from the provided API and possibly other data sources to present insights through visualizations, comparisons, and interactive elements.

## Objectives

- **Use React**: You will use React and any other npm packages and/or frameworks you wish in order to create your application. There are no requirements on which technologies you use.
- **Use React**: Make your project visually appealing through Vanilla CSS or any CSS Framework you wish to use
- **Fetch Data**: Your application must consume the NYC Squirrel Census API and can optionally use other APIs or data from the web.
- **Visualization**: Present the data in an engaging and interactive way. You can use dashboards, tables, charts, heatmaps, or even creative text displays like word art.
- **Data Manipulation**: Include calculations to make comparisons and derive insights from the data.
- **Beyond Display**: _Do not merely fetch and display data;_ add value by processing, filtering, and summarizing before presenting it.

## Requirements

- **Teamwork**: Work individually or in pairs.
- **API Usage**: Must use the [NYC Squirrel Census API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data).
- **Interactivity**: Your app should allow user interaction to explore different aspects of the data.
- **Creative Presentation**: Use innovative ways to visualize the data. Avoid simple listings of API data.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:
   - Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub profile.
   - After forking, go to your GitHub profile, find the forked repository, and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Explore the API**: Familiarize yourself with the [NYC Squirrel Census API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data). Understand the data fields and response format.
3. **Plan Your Application**:
   - **Decide on the type of visualization and comparison metrics**:
     - **Example Comparison**: Compare the frequency of squirrel activities such as foraging and eating across different parks in NYC. Calculate and visualize the percentage of squirrels engaged in these activities within each park to identify which park has the most active squirrel population.
     - Consider how to display this information. You might use a bar chart to represent each park with bars colored differently for each activity. Alternatively, a pie chart for each park could show the proportion of each activity.
   - **Sketch out a rough design and UI flow**:
     - Map out how users will navigate your app. Consider what happens when a user clicks on a park name. Will it show more detailed stats for that park, or will there be a separate section for detailed park comparisons?
     - **Interactive Components Requirement**: You are required to create at least one interactive component, such as a filterable map or a dynamic chart. You can choose to build this as one comprehensive component or as several smaller, interconnected components, each displaying different facets of the data.
   - **Identify any additional APIs or datasets you might want to integrate**:
     - You might find it helpful to integrate additional geographical data or data on park visitor numbers to enrich your comparisons.
4. **Development**:
   - Set up API calls to fetch the data.
   - Implement the UI components.
   - Add interactivity and data processing logic.
5. **Testing**: Ensure your app works across different devices and has no major bugs.
6. **Documentation**: Write clear documentation in your README about how to set up and run your project.

## Submission

- Commit your completed project to this GitHub repository.
- Include a `README.md` with setup instructions and a brief description of your project and its features.

## Presentation

- **Present Your Project**: At the end of the project, you will present your application to the cohort. This presentation should include a demonstration of the functionality, an explanation of the key features, and a brief discussion of the challenges you faced and the solutions you implemented.
